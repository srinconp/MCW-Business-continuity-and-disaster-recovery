# Business continuity and disaster recovery hands-on lab step-by-step 

## Abstract 

In this hands-on lab, you will implement three different environments and use Azure BCDR technologies to achieve three distinct goals for each environment type. These will include a migration to Azure, Azure region to region failover, and a PaaS implementation using BCDR technologies to ensure high availability of an application.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to build a complex and robust IaaS BCDR solution.  

## Overview

The Business continuity and disaster recovery hands-on lab is an exercise that will challenge you to implement a BCDR solution that includes three different environments and uses Azure BCDR technologies to achieve three distinct goals for each environment type. These will include a migration to Azure, Azure region to region failover using Azure Site Recovery (ASR), and a PaaS implementation using BCDR technologies to ensure high availability of an application.

The hands-on lab can be implemented on your own, but it is highly recommended to pair up with other members at the lab to model a real-world experience and to allow each member to share their expertise for the overall solution.

## Solution architecture

Below are diagrams of the solution architecture you will build in this lab. Please study this carefully, so you understand the whole of the solution as you are working on the various components.

### Environment: On-premises (migrate to Azure)

-   **Background:** This environment will deploy a Hyper-V Host that will host a Linux VM to simulate a Linux, Apache, PHP, and MySQL (LAMP) based web application deployed into an on-premises datacenter on a single VM.

-   **Goal using Azure BCDR:** Your goal for this environment will be to migrate this application to Azure IaaS with a one-direction failover.

    ![The on-premises migration diagram has on-premises, azure platform, and secondary region sections. On-premises has a hyper-v host and a linux on-premises virtual machine. Azure Platform uses Azure Site Recovery. The secondary region has an on-premises Linux VM as well.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image2.png "On-premises migration diagram")

### Environment: Azure IaaS (failover region to region)

-   **Background:** This environment will consist of two Virtual Networks deployed to your Primary and Secondary site with an AD Domain, IIS Web Servers and Microsoft SQL Servers that you will configure into a SQL Always On Availability Group.

-   **Goal using Azure BCDR:** Your goal for this environment is to have the ability to have a one-click failover process using Azure Site Recovery in either direction. The users will have one URL that they will use to connect to your application regardless of where the application is running.

    ![Diagram of the Azure IaaS failover region to region solution.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image3.png "Azure IaaS failover region to region solution")

### Environment: Azure PaaS (high-availability with seamless failover)

-   **Background:** This environment will deploy an Azure Web App and Azure SQL Server in both the Primary and Secondary locations. You will configure SQL Database Failover groups to allow for seamless failover of the database.

-   **Goal using Azure BCDR:** Your goal for this environment is never to have the users experience any downtime if issues arise with your Web App or the SQL Database. The users will have one URL that they will use to connect to your application regardless of where the application or database is running.

![Diagram of the Azure PaaS high availability with seamless failover solution.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image4.png "Azure PaaS high availability with seamless failover diagram")

## Requirements

1.  An Azure Subscription with full access to the environment.

## Exercise 1: Deploy Azure environments

Duration: 15 minutes (Deployments can take as long as 75 minutes)

In this exercise, you will use Azure ARM Templates to deploy the following environments that will be used in this HOL:

-   **Azure IaaS:** This environment will consist of two Virtual Networks deployed to your Primary and Secondary site with an AD Domain, IIS Web Servers and Microsoft SQL Servers that you will configure into a SQL Always On Availability Group.

-   **On-premises:** This environment will deploy a Hyper-V Host that will host a Linux VM to simulate a web application deployed into on-premises datacenter on a single VM. Your goal for this environment will be to migrate this application to Azure IaaS with a one-direction failover.

-   **Azure PaaS:** This environment will deploy an Azure Web App and Azure SQL Server in both the Primary and Secondary locations.

81. Once the second endpoint has been added, select **Overview**. Notice that the Primary endpoint is set to **Priority 1**. This means that traffic will always be directed to the **Primary** site unless it is down. The Traffic Manager will monitor the Endpoints, and if the **Primary** site moves to a **Monitor Status** of **Degraded**, then the Traffic Manager will direct traffic to the **Secondary** site. The current **Monitor Status** shows that the **Primary** site is **Online** and the Secondary site is **Degraded**. During a failover using ASR, the **Primary** site will move to **Degraded,** and the **Secondary** will move to **Online**. This will allow for traffic to flow to the failed over IaaS infrastructure now running at the **Secondary** site. This will, of course, revert during the failback to the **Primary** site.

    ![In the Traffic Manager profile blade, a callout points to the monitor status, which is Online.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image222.png "Traffic Manager profile blade")

>**Note:** All of this is automatic and easily configured with a vanity domain by adding a C NAME record in DNS to point to the DNS name of the Traffic Manager. This would allow for a site like [www.contoso.com](http://www.contoso.com) to resolve to the DNS name of the traffic manager. The users will never know that the site is failed over or failed back.

82. Select the DNS name of the Traffic manager the Policy Connect web application will load. This is connecting to the **WWWEXTLB** External Load Balancer that is in front of **WEBVM1** and **WEBVM2** running in the **Primary** Site in **BCDRIaaSPrimarySite** resource group and connecting to the SQL Always On Listener at the same location.

    ![The DNS name link is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image223.png "DNS name link")

51. Select the **Current Policy Offerings** button, and the page should load with data showing. This means that you have successfully implemented the Web App, and it has connected to the Failover Group database.

    ![The Index webpage displays the insurance options.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image307.png "Index webpage")

52. Close Visual Studio and move back to the Azure Portal. The next step will be to deploy a Traffic Manager for this PaaS implementation. Select **+Create a resource, Networking then Traffic Manager profile** in the Azure portal.

    ![In the Azure Portal, under Azure Marketplace, Networking and Traffic Manager profile are both selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image213.png "Azure Portal")

53. Complete the **Create Traffic Manager profile** using the following inputs, then select **Create**:

    -   **Name:** Unique name all lowercase using bcdrpaasxxx.

    -   **Routing method:** Performance

    -   **Resource group:** Use existing / BCDRPaasPrimarySite

    -   **Location:** Automatically assigned based on the BCDRPaaSPrimarySite.

        ![In the Create Traffic Manager profile blade, fields display the previously defined settings.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image308.png "Create Traffic Manager profile blade")

54. Once the Traffic Manager profile is created, open it in the Azure portal. Notice the DNS name. This is the URL that you will use to connect to the application. Once configured this DNS name will always respond and doesn't matter which location is responding or where if the current primary database is located. Since the **Performance** routing method was selected the closest site to the end users will be calculated and they will be sent to that location. If for some reason one of the sites is down the other will service all requests.

    ![The Routing method of Performance has a callout pointing to it.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image309.png "Routing method")

55. Select **Configuration** and review the configurations.

    ![Under Settings, Configuration is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image216.png "Settings section")

    -   **Name**: BCDRPaaSPrimarySite

    -   **Target resource type**: App Service

    -   **Target resource**: Choose an app service.

    -   **Resource:** BCDRPrimarySiteContosoInsurancexxx in the BCDRPaaSPrimarySite

    ![In the Add endpoint blade, fields display the following settings: Type, Azure endpoint; Name, BCDRPaaSPrimarySite; Target resource type, App Service; Target resource, Choose an app service. In the Resource blade, the BCDRPaaSPrimarySite is called out.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image311.png "Add endpointand Resource blades")

59. Select **+Add**. Notice that the Primary endpoint was created as **"Enabled"**.

    ![The Add button is selected in the Traffic Manager profile blade.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image312.png "Traffic Manager profile blade")

60. Complete the **Add endpoint** using the following inputs and then select **OK**:

    -   **Type:** Azure endpoint

    -   **Name**: BCDRPaaSSecondarySite

    -   **Target resource type**: App Service

        ![In the Add endpoint blade, fields display the previously defined settings.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image313.png "Add endpoint blade")

61. Once the second endpoint has been added select **Overview**. The Traffic Manager will monitor the Endpoints and if the **Primary** or **Secondary** site moves to a **Monitor Status** of **Degraded**, then the Traffic Manager will direct traffic only to the other site until the service is restored. The current **Monitor Status** shows that the **Primary** site and the **Secondary** site are **Online**. If there was an outage at the web layer for one of these sites then the site will move to **Degraded,** and the other site will service all requests.

    ![In the Overview section, a callout points to the status of enabled for the Primary and Secondary sites.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image314.png "Overview section")

>**Note:** All of this is automatic and easily configured with a vanity domain by adding a C NAME record in DNS to point to the DNS name of the Traffic manager. This would allow for a site like [www.contoso.com](http://www.contoso.com) to resolve to the DNS name of the traffic manager. The users will never know that the site is failed over or failed back as long as one site is up and the database is active in the Failover group.

62. Select the DNS name of the Traffic manager the Policy Connect web application will load. This is connecting to one of the two Web Apps running in the **Primary** Site or **Secondary** Site and talking to the Azure SQL Database Failover Group primary replica using the SQL FOG Listener.

    ![The DNS name link is called out.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image315.png "DNS name")

## Exercise 4: Simulate failovers 

Duration: 75 minutes

Now, that your applications have been made ready for high-availability and BCDR you will now simulate their capabilities. First, you will Failover the **Azure IaaS environment** from your **Primary** to **Secondary** Region. Next, you will migrate the **On-Premises** environment to Azure. The **PaaS** environment will be tested to ensure that failing over the database doesn't cause an outage to the application. Finally, you will failback the Azure IaaS environment from the **Secondary** site to the **Primary** site.

### Task 1: Failover Azure IaaS region to region

![The Azure IaaS region to region failover diagram displays.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image317.png "Azure IaaS region to region failover diagram")

1.  Using the Azure portal, open the **BCDRIaaSPrimarySite** resource group. Locate the Traffic Manager DNS URL and select it to ensure that the application is up and running form the Primary Site. Pin the Traffic manager to your dashboard for easy access to this URL or make a favorite in your browser.

    ![The DNS name link is called out.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image318.png "DNS name")

2.  From the Azure portal, open the **BCDRRSV** Recovery Services Vault located in the **BCDRAzureSiteRecovery** resource group.

6.  On the warning about No Test Failover, select **I understand the risk, Skip test failover**.

    ![A warning displays that no test failover has been done in the past 180 days, and recommends that you do one before a failover. At the bottom, the I understand and skip test failover checkbox is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image322.png "Failover warning")

7.  Review the Failover direction. Notice that **From** is the **Primary** site, and **To** is the **Secondary** site. Select **OK**.

    ![Callouts in the Failover blade point to the From and To fields.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image323.png "Failover blade")

8.  After the Failover is initiated close the blade and move to **Site Recovery Jobs**. Select the **Failover** job to monitor the progress.

    ![Failover is selected in the Site Recover jobs blade.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image324.png "Site Recover jobs blade")

9.  You can monitor the progress of the Failover from here.

    ![Screenshot of the Site Recover jobs blade with progress status displaying.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image325.png "Site Recover jobs blade")

>**Note:** Do not make any changes to your VMs in the Azure portal during this process. Allow ASR to take the actions and wait for the failover notification prior to moving on to the next step. You can open another portal view in a new browser tab and review the output of the Azure Automation Jobs, by opening the jobs and selecting Output.

   ![Output is selected on the Job blade, and information displays in the Output blade.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image326.png "Job and Output blades")

20. Using the Azure portal to locate the **BCDRIaaS** **Traffic Manager** profile in the **BCDRIaaSPrimarySite** resource group. Notice that the Monitor Status has moved to **Degraded** for the **Primary** Site and moved to **Online** for the **Secondary** site.

    ![In the Traffic Manager profile blade, a callout points to the degraded status of the primary site.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image337.png "Traffic Manager profile blade")

21. Select **DNS Name URL**. The site load immediately and is failed over. The users will always be using this DNS URL, so there is no change in how they access the site even though it is failed over. There **will** be downtime as the failover happens, but once the site is back online the experience for them will be no different than when it is running in the **Primary** site.

    ![The Contoso Insurance PolicyConnect webpage displays with a callout pointing to the URL in the address bar.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image338.png "Contoso Insurance PolicyConnect webpage")

**Optional task**: If you wish, you can RDP to **SQLVM3** and open the SQL Management Studio to review the Failed over **BCDRAOG**. You will see that **SQLVM3** which is running the **Secondary** site is now the Primary Replica.

22. Now, that you have successfully failed over you need to prep ASR for the Failback. Move back to the **BCDRSRV** Recovery Service Vault using the Azure portal. Select Recovery Plans on the ASR dashboard.

    ![The Recovery Plans tile displays 1.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image339.png "Recovery Plans tile")

    ![In the Public IP address blade, a callout points to the DNS name.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image393.png "Public IP address blade")

17. The Application running on the **WEBVM1** and **WEBVM2** is now responding from the **Primary** Site. Make sure to select the current **Policy Offerings** to ensure that there is connectivity to the SQL Always On group that was also failed back to primary in the background.

    ![The Contoso Insurance PolicyConnect webpage displays with a callout pointing to the URL in the address bar.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image394.png "Contoso Insurance PolicyConnect webpage")

    ![On the Index - Policy Connect tab webpage coverage options display.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image395.png "Index - Policy Connect tab webpage")

18. Using the Azure portal, locate the **BCDRIaaS** **Traffic Manager** profile in the **BCDRIaaSPrimarySite** resource group. Notice that the Monitor Status has moved to **Degraded** for the **Secondary** Site and moved to **Online** for **Primary** the site.

    ![In the Resource group blade, a callout points to the mointor status of degraded.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image396.png "Resource group blade")

19. Select the **DNS Name URL**. The site load immediately and is failed over. The users will always be using this DNS URL, so they there is no change in how they access the site even though it is failed over.

    ![Screenshot of the DNS name link.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image397.png "DNS name link")

    ![The Contoso Insurance PolicyConnect webpage displays with a callout pointing to the URL in the address bar.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image338.png "Contoso Insurance PolicyConnect webpage")

20. Now, that you have successfully failed back you need to prep ASR for the Failover again. Move back to the **BCDRSRV** Recovery Service Vault using the Azure portal. Select Recovery Plans on the ASR dashboard.

    ![A Recovery Plans tile with the number 1 displays.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image339.png "Recovery Plans tile")

21. The BCDRIaaSPlan will show as **Failover completed**. Select the Plan.

    ![In the BCDRSRV blade a callout points to the failover completed message.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image340.png "BCDRSRV blade")

22. Notice that now 2 VMs are shown in the **Source**.

23. Select **More**, then select **Re-protect**.

    ![In the BCDRSRV blade, the More ellipses is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image342.png "BCDRSRV blade")

24. On the **Re-protect** screen review the configuration and then select **OK**.

    ![The BCDRIaaSPlan blade displays.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image398.png "BCDRIaaSPlan blade")

25. The portal will submit a deployment. This process will take some time, by first committing the failover and then synchronizing the **WEBVM1** and **WEBVM2** back to the **Primary** Site. Once this process is complete, then you will be able to Fail over again from the **Primary** to **Secondary** site from the perspective of ASR.

26. Select **Resource groups** in the Azure portal and notice that two new Resource groups have been created with -asr in their names. These are used by ASR for the Failover and Failback, so they should be left in place.

    ![A list of Resource groups displays, two of which are: BCDRIaaSPrimarySite-asr, and BCDRIaaSPrimarySite-asr-1. ](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image399.png "Resource groups")

27. Next, you need to reset the SQL AOG environment to ensure a proper failover. To do this open Remote Desktop to **BCDRDC1** and then jump to **SQLVM1** using Remote desktop.

28. Once connected to **SQLVM1** open SQL Management Studio and Connect to **SQLVM1**. Expand the **Always On Availably Group**s and then right-click on **BCDRAOG** and then select **Show Dashboard**.

    ![In SQL Management Studio, the right-click menu for BCDRAOG (Primary) displays, and Show Dashboard is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image198.png "SQL Management Studio")

29. Notice that all the Replica partners are now Synchronous Commit with Automatic Failover Mode. You need to manually reset **SQLVM3** to be **Asynchronous** with **Manual Failover**.

    ![The Availability group dashboard displays with SQLVM3 and its properties called out.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image400.png "Availability group dashboard")

30. Right-click the **BCDRAOG** and select **Properties**.

    ![In Object Explorer, the right-click menu for BCDRAOG displays with Properties selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image401.png "Object Explorer")

31. Change **SQLVM3** to **Asynchronous** and **Manual Failover** and select **OK**.

    ![In the Availability Group Properties window, under Availability Replicas, the SQLVM3 server role is secondary, availability mode is asynchronous commit, and failover mode is manual.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image402.png "Availability Group Properties window")

32. Show the Availability Group Dashboard again. Notice that they change has been made and that the AOG is now reset.

    ![The Availability group dashboard displays, with SQLVM3 and its properties called out.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image403.png "Availability group dashboard")

>**Note:** This task could have been done using the Azure Automation script during Failback, but more DBAs would prefer a good, clean failback and then do this manually once they are comfortable with the failback.

## After the hands-on lab 

Duration: 15 minutes

There are many items that were created as a part of this lab, and they should be deleted once you no longer desire to retain the environments.

### Task 1: Disable replication in the recovery services vault

1.  To clean up the environment, you must first disable the replication of the **WEBVM1, WEBVM2** and **OnPremVM** in the **BCDRSRV** Recovery Service Vault. Open **BCDRSRV** in the Azure portal and select **Replicated Items** in the **Protected Items** area.

    ![Under Protected items, Replicated items is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image404.png "Protected items section")

2.  Select the **Ellipse** next to each replicated item and then select **Disable Replication**. On the following screen select **OK**.

    ![From the ellipses menu, Disable Replication is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image405.png "Disable Replication option")

3.  After this process is completed you can move on to the next task.

### Task 2: Delete all BCDR resource groups

1.  Using the Azure Portal delete each of the BCDR Resource Groups that you created:

|    |            |       
|----------|:-------------:|
| **Resource Group Name** | **Location** |
| **BCDRAzureAutomation** | Your Location |
| **BCDRAzureSiteRecovery** | Secondary |
| **BCDRIaaSPrimarySite** | Primary |
| **BCDRIaaSSecondarySite** | Secondary |
| **BCDRLabRG** | Your Location |
| **BCDROnPremPrimarySite** | Primary |
| **BCDROnPremPrimarySite-asr** | Primary |
| **BCDROnPremPrimarySite-asr-1** | Primary |
| **BCDRPaaSPrimarySite** | Primary |
| **BCDRPaaSSecondarySite** | Secondary |

You should follow all steps provided *after* attending the Hands-on lab.
