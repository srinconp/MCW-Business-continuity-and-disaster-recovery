18. Change to **Off** for Administrators and Users then select **OK**.

    ![In the Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration dialog box, Administrators is set to Off, and Users is set to Off.](images/Setup/image16.png "Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration dialog box")

### Task 2: Download hands-on support files to LABVM

1.  Download the zipped Hands-on Lab Step by Step student files at this link:

    <https://www.dropbox.com/s/mfy0hx84ljie3rq/StudentFiles.zip?dl=1>

2.  Extract the files to a directory here **C:\\HOL** on LABVM.

### Task 3: Install SQL Server Express on LABVM

1.  From within LABVM open Internet Explorer and browse to the following URL:

    <https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/sql-server/sql-server-downloads>

2.  Click **Download now** under the Express edition.

### Task 4: Create the resource groups

In this task, you will select a **Primary** and **Secondary** Azure Region that will be used for the remainder of the HOL. The **Primary** region should be able to **support V3 virtual machine** sizes, and then you should select the **Secondary** region based on the region pair assigned by Microsoft. Use the Products available by region webpage to determine your **Primary** site: <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/regions/services/>. Once you have selected the Primary site, then review the BCDR page to find your Primary Site's Region Pair: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/best-practices-availability-paired-regions>.

>**Note:** The examples in this HOL Guide use these regions: **Primary:** East US 2 and **Secondary**: Central US.

1.  From the **LABVM**, open Internet Explorer and connect to the Azure portal at: <https://portal.azure.com>.

2.  Select **Resource groups**, the select **+Add**.

    ![On the Azure Portal Resource groups blade, the Add button is selected.](images/Setup/image23.png "Azure Portal, Resource groups blade")

3.  Complete the **Resource group** blade using the following inputs and select **Create**:

    -   **Resource group name**: BCDRIaaSPrimarySite

    -   **Subscription**: Select your Subscription.

    -   **Resource group location**: Select a Region for the Primary location.

        ![In the Resource group blade, fields are set to the previously defined settings.](images/Setup/image24.png "Resource group blade")

>**Note:** It's very important for you to use these exact names. Changing the names of the Resource groups will impact the HOL setup and could cause you not to be able to complete the lab.

4.  Select **Resource groups**, then select **+Add**

    ![On the Azure Portal Resource groups blade, the Add button is selected.](images/Setup/image23.png "Azure Portal, Resource groups blade")

5.  Complete the **Resource group** blade using the following inputs and select **Create**.

    -   **Resource group name**: BCDRIaaSSecondarySite

    -   **Subscription**: Select your Subscription.

    -   **Resource group location**: Select a Region for the Secondary location.

        ![In the Resource group blade, fields are set to the previously defined settings.](images/Setup/image25.png "Resource group blade")

6.  Continue to add resource groups to support the HOL.

|    |            |       
|----------|:-------------:|
| **Resource Group Name** | **Location** |
| **BCDRAzureAutomation** | Any available site other than your Primary or Secondary |
| **BCDRAzureSiteRecovery** | Secondary |
| **BCDROnPremPrimarySite** | Primary |
| **BCDRPaaSPrimarySite** | Primary |
| **BCDRPaaSSecondarySite** | Secondary |

7.  Once all the resource groups have been created, you should review all the resource groups for this HOL. **It is critical to ensure that the spelling is correct and that they are in the correct Azure Regions (Primary or Secondary)**.

>**Note:** If for some reason there is an error, you should delete the resource group with the error and recreate it.

8.  Here is the Azure Portal with each of the resource groups created in the correct Azure Region:

    ![In the Resource groups blade, various resource groups and their locations are listed.](images/Setup/image26.png "Resource groups blade")

You should follow all steps provided *before* attending the Hands-on lab.
